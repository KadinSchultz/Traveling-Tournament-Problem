# Traveling Tournament Problem
This repository contains the files and code I've written to generate near-optimal solutions to Michael Trick's Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP), using an evolutionary algorithm.

> The Travelling Tournament Problem is a sports timetabling problem requiring production of a minimum distance double round-robin tournament for a group of n teams. Even small instances of this problem seem to be very difficult to solve. In this paper, we present the first provably optimal solution for an instance of eight teams. The solution methodology is a parallel implementation of a branch-and-price algorithm that uses integer programming to solve the master problem and constraint programming to solve the pricing problem. Additionally, constraint programming is used as a primal heuristic.

(Easton, Nemhauser, & Trick, 2001)

Whilst typically an exercise in constraint programming and optimisation, this code will use randomly generated schedules and mutations in an evolutionary algorithm to create mirrored round-robin instances for the 'National League' datasets.
